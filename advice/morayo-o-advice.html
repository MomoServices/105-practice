                <h4>Google is your friend.</h4>
                <p>As awesome as Skillcrush is, it is still at best, a box of labeled leggos. You have to want to know more about the skill you're learning in order to thrive at it. I find myself in so many of these exercises still looking for clarifications and answers on forums. Great thing about Google is that if you look well enough, someone has already dealt with, and solved the issues that you're battle with right this moment. So, you're never really alone.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Celebrate every progress point!</h4>
                <p>There are two kinds of people. The determined night owl, that bangs their head on a wall trying to crack the codes and get a job asap, and there is the other who is also a night owl, celebrating every stride just like completing another level on a game. This person is also trying to break the code, and get a job asap!</p>

                <p>Your approach to learning on here, will determine if you're looking forward to signing in, or if it gives you a headache just thinking about it. Skillcrush makes it super easy though. They celebrate you even when you forget to celebrate yourself.</p>

                <p>So I will highly recommend celbrating yourself. It can literally be the difference between success here, and abandoning the project. You got this!</p>
